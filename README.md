I am including a couple of Power BI Dashboards in this platform.

This finincial dashboard power BI PDF visualizes ways to look at a set of  demographics regarding the sales and profit of several different products from a couple different countries. The original source is a CSV file on Kaggle. 
The original data consists of several countries, the amounts of units sold, gross sales, profits, and more.

Link below consists the original data source.

Also, I create a Power BI based on corporate sales profits for major beverages including Coca Cola, and Fanta. Below is the link to access webpage to download the excel file. I converted the excel file into a CSV prior to data visualization in Power BI.
